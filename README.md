# JavaScript playground

Minimalistic HTML and CSS assets for writing a Memory card game (or something similar) in JavaScript. This is just a static web page to get you started, you'll have to write the JavaScript code yourself.

Ideas:

- Generate the cards from data instead of writing down all their HTML
- Play the "reveal" animation when a card is clicked, not on hover
- Allow no more than two cards to be face up at the same time
- When the player reveals two different cards, turn them face down again
- When the player reveals two identical cards, discard the cards or mark them as "done" somehow
- Show how much time the player took to finish a game
- Implement a high score list
- ...

Please don't get too inspired by my HTML or CSS, I suck at CSS ðŸ˜„
